# Simple MVC architecture in Deno

> NOTE: Not ready for production

So far I've never created my own routers, ioc containers or similiar and thought why not build it with a new runtime such as Deno and kill two birds with one stone. So I did and this is the result. There are a lot of things missing and I'll add them over time. The overall concept and some names are influenced heavily by AdonisJS framework.
